/**
 * You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street.
 * Each house has a certain amount of money stashed,
 * the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses
 * have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police
 * if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
 *
 * Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house,
 * determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: [1,2,3,1]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
 *              Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: [2,7,9,3,1]
 * Output: 12
 * Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
 *              Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
